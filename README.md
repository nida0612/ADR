# Architecture decision record (ADR)

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are formal documents that systematically capture critical architectural decisions made during an initiative's lifecycle. They include the context, rationale, and implications of each decision, providing a comprehensive historical record that aids in understanding and maintaining the architectural integrity of the system.
