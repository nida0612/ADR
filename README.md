# Architecture decision record (ADR)

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are formal documents that systematically capture critical architectural decisions made during an initiative's lifecycle. They include the context, rationale, and implications of each decision, providing a comprehensive historical record that aids in understanding and maintaining the architectural integrity of the system.

### Usage guidelines 
 - Each ADR is a plain text, 1-2 page document
 - ADRs should be numbered
 - ADRs should be stored within each software project repo
 - Create a separate repo for crosscutting ADRs
 - Track ADRs in the backlog
 - Review ADRs
 - Create ADRs for *significant* design decisions
 - This template is a suggestion that you may want to adopt or adapt. In any case, establishing and sharing a template for ADRs in your team or organization is a good idea.

### ADR File Naming Conventions

1. **Sequential Numbering**: Use a sequential number to keep track of the order of decisions.
2. **Date-Based**: Include the date of the decision in the file name.
4. **Project-Specific Prefix**: Add a project-specific prefix to the file name.
5. **Combination**: Combine all of the above for clarity.

Example names: 
* projectname-2025-05-05-v3.7.md
* projectname-2025-05-06-v1.2.md
* projectname-2025-05-07-v4.6.md
