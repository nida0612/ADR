# Architecture decision record (ADR)

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are formal documents that systematically capture critical architectural decisions made during an initiative's lifecycle. They include the context, rationale, and implications of each decision, providing a comprehensive historical record that aids in understanding and maintaining the architectural integrity of the system.

### Usage guidelines 

 - Each ADR is a plain text, 1-2 page document at max
 - ADRs should be stored within each software project repo
 - Include diagrams if they aid understanding.
 - Provide references and links. Avoid copying content unless essential or simplifies explanation.
 - Follow the File Naming Conventions
 - Create ADRs for *significant* design decisions

### ADR File Naming Conventions

1. **Sequential Numbering**: Use a sequential number to keep track of the order of decisions.
2. **Date-Based**: Include the date of the decision in the file name.
4. **Project-Specific Prefix**: Add a project-specific prefix to the file name.
5. **Combination**: Combine all of the above for clarity.

Example names: 
* projectname-2025-05-05-v3.7.md
* projectname-2025-05-06-v1.2.md
* projectname-2025-05-07-v4.6.md
